# Basic Project Plan
# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

# Tasks
    - API Call to USGS website (GeoJSON earthquake data) 
    - retrieve geographical coordinates & magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 
    - Add the data to a map.

#Approach
    - use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
    - use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
